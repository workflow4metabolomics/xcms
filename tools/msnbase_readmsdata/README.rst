- UPGRADE: upgrade the MSnbase version from 2.4.0 to 2.8.2 (see MSnbase News_). Almost all the new features may not concern our usage of MSnbase.

**Version 2.4.0.0 - 29/03/2018**

- NEW: a new dedicated tool to read the raw data. This function was previously included in xcms.findChromPeaks. This way, you will now be able to display TICs and BPCs before xcms.findChromPeaks.
